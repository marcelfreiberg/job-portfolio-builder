# Job Application Portfolio

I got tired of fighting with Word templates and wanted something that actually looks good, so I built this React-based portfolio for job applications.

## Quick Start

```bash
git clone <repo-url>
cd applications
pnpm install
pnpm dev
```

## Setup

1. Copy `src/data/personal.template.json` to `src/data/personal.json`
2. Edit `src/data/personal.json` with your information
3. Add your photo to `src/assets/`
4. Create company files in `src/data/jobs/` (see `example_company.json`)
